GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:

The goal of this collaborative project is to make an online marketplace at Rice University for selling all
sorts of stuff.

By online marketplace, we mean a place where we a signed-in user can add an item for sale (name, pictures, listing price, contact email)
 and other users excluding the lister can click interested or not interested.
 We don't facilitate DM'ing but that can be added later.

The Web Application consists of users and items they have put up for sale.

A user is someone who:
1) buys items,
2) sells items
3) or neither on the website.





An item is abstractly an
1) an image of an object AND
2) string description of the object AND
3) and current price of the object.

Later on:
1) List of people who have expressed interested in the item
2)

Once an item is assigned to a user it sticks with the user until:
1) The user indicates the item as sold
2) The user deletes the item
